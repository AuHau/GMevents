synopsis:
  -
    There are many talented musicians among developers, and DEVCON4 will make 
    no exception. My idea is to organise a Halloween party - DEVil Jam at Paralelni, where 
    everyone can have a good time and those musicians can hack together some nice
    grooves.
  -
    I am a sound tech and musician myself and I can take of all the technical part related to the stage
    backline and sounds. I believe Paralelni Polis - Bitcoin Coffee would possibly be the best location to host it.
  -
    The whole eve can be livestreamed on Livepeer.tv using Livepeer decentralized video streaming 
    protocol.
