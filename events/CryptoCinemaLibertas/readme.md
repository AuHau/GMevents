synopsis:
  - Screening of the first Slovak-Czech documentary film about cryptocurrencies called Libertas (2020).
  - The original Czech-Slovak version with English subtitles will be screened at Cinema Světozor on Friday, 3 June 2022 at 18:00 in the evening. The film will be followed by a discussion with guests.
  - The feature-length documentary Libertas is a probe into the world of crypto-technology in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Using stories of innovators, experimenters, successful entrepreneurs, educators, and testimonies of skeptics, leaders of state and financial institutions, economists and scientists, it tries to explain the topic of cryptocurrencies, blockchain, the financial system and digital freedom to ordinary people. It seeks answers to questions about how these technologies work, what benefits they bring, what impact their widespread adoption might have on society and individuals, and why it is important to care about them. Social injustice and the incompetence of our public representatives have long polarized our society. Some people have chosen to minimize the negative impact of the state and financial institutions on their lives by using crypto-technology. Others are shaping successful companies, and pushing development forward. But many are resisting these technologies. Whatever one's view of them, one thing is certain: the next few decades will show their true potential.
