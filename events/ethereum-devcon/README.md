synopsis:
  -
    What is Devcon all about?
     Devcon is our annual Ethereum family reunion. We at the Ethereum Foundation 
     host Devcon to educate and empower our community to build decentralized 
     applications, and to bring Ethereum protocols, tools, and culture to the world.

    Who is Devcon for?    
     The name Devcon refers to a developer conference. While the majority of the 
     programming & content will be deeply technical, we think of developers as 
     builders of all kinds - designers, UX researchers, smart contract devs, 
     blockchain researchers, client implementers, test engineers, infrastructure 
     operators, community organizers, and even artists in the community.
  -
    Who is Devcon not for?
     Devcon is not a place for sharing or listening to investment promotions. 
     Participants focused on the financial value of ETH or other investments 
     will detract from the intended experience.
