### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.berlin/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

synopsis:
  - ETHPrague is not looking for the next get rich quickly scheme or groundbreaking DeFi apps, instead it is an 
    event focusing on the future potential of Ethereum and concepts or applications which do not yet exist. We want to 
    tackle challenges which will or might arise in the next decade and we believe Ethereum will play a major role in 
    solving these. The future is in your hands, anon! You decide whether we end up living in a dark authoritarian 
    dystopia or a bright solarpunk utopia.
