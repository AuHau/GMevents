synopsis:
  -
    The Protea team warmly invites all Ethereum Meetup Organisers to our 
      get together during DevCon4.
  -
    The Ethereum community is growing rapidly, already having surpassed 
      over 1 Million global meetup.com community members. Without this 
      community and those that drive it’s growth, Ethereum would not be 
      where it is today. We want to bring together all those who will be in town
      that play an active part in building the Ethereum community.
  -
    The aim of this meetup is to provide an open platform for organisers 
      to share ideas, ask questions, talk about the Ethereum community 
      and network within the industry in a fun and engaging environment. 
      Essentially, connecting Ethereum meetup organisers who are 
      attending DevCon4.
  -
    Looking forward to seeing you all there! If you have any questions, 
      don’t hesitate to get in touch.
