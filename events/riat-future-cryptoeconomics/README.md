####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.berlin/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

    The launch of FUTURE CRYPTOECONOMICS - a quarterly publication that examines the global 
  cryptoeconomic condition and its effects on culture and society.
  -
    Future Cryptoeconomics are debated and tested in almost real-time, and we have a long way to go 
  in order to achieve ‘cryptoeconomic literacy’ and global adoption of cryptocurrency. Could anxiety 
  foster mass adoption of cryptocurrencies? The transparency vs. privacy debate, or the shortcomings 
  of fiat, banks and large financial institutions? The first issue seeks not to find answers to 
  speculations, but to identify the questions that are foundational for envisioning next societies.

  Cryptoeconomics that contains contributions from and interviews with: Matthias Tarasiewicz, Andreas 
  Antonopoulos, Jaya Klara Brekke, Josh Stark, Shintaro Miyazaki, Vitalik Buterin, Ozan Polat, Benedikt
