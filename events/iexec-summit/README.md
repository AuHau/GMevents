synopsis:
  -
    The iExec team invite you to join us for a whole afternoon and evening of free blockchain and tech themed workshops, 
    talks, discussions; food, drink and parties!

    Which computing infrastructure for a decentralized world?
  - 
    As we enter the era of decentralization, we will see profound changes in the foundations of the Internet itself. 
    Public blockchains such as Ethereum become the central element of decentralized applications. Smart contract 
    programming allows for the exchange of value and data, solves identification and authorization problems and brings 
    out new algorithms for consensus and economic incentives. Nevertheless we are still far from the promise of a 
    “global computer”.
  -  
    In coordination with Devcon4 conference, the first iExec workshop aims to bring together those for whom 
    infrastructure and evolution of the internet is an important subject. The summit will be attended by Dapp 
    developers, miners, blockchain hackers decentralized protocol designers from startups, industry, academic 
    backgrounds.
  - 
    The objective of the workshop is to exchange experiences on the implementation of these emerging blockchain-based 
    decentralized infrastructures. A high-level program of reputable speakers from the field will address topics such 
    as scalability, security, performance, protocol design and evaluation, and many more. A particular focus on iExec 
    will allow everyone to get hands-on with the technology in a simple and informative way. In addition, several 
    sessions will be dedicated to executing real life applications. The workshop is free and open to the general public.
    Anyone interested in learning more about using state-of-the-art technologies around the Ethereum blockchain is welcome.
