### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.berlin/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.
