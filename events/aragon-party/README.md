    The Aragon team invites you to join us in Prague on November 1st for an evening of entertainment and community.
  -
    Do you dream about using Decentralized Autonomous Organizations to improve your community? We are offering a chance to help make your dreams come true!
  -
    After socializing over food and drinks, we will be hosting the first Dream DAO pitch contest. Attendees will be able to sign up to give a five minute pitch of their Dream DAO for a chance to win a grand prize of 500 ANT and 500 DAI, with a runner up prize of 250 ANT and 250 DAI. 
  -
    Pitches will be judged by a panel of Aragon community members based on the potential positive impact of the DAO and the realistic likelihood that the DAO will succeed when it is launched. Bonus points will be given for creativity and ambition!
  -
    After the pitch contest, we will continue partying into the night, chilling and dancing to beats mixed by talented DJs from the Ethereum community.
