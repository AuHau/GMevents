synopsis:
  -
    As Prague Blockchain week quickly approaches and new workshops, meetups, and hackathons pop up each day, it is evident that the community has drastically grown since Devcon3 in Cancun just a year ago. Proof that Devcon, the annual Ethereum conference, brings together people from all disciplines and backgrounds who share a common belief in the decentralised web we are collectively building. A key figure in the push for this decentralized vision is the team behind the distributed storage platform and content distribution network – SWARM.  
  -
    We are pleased to open up the Status Hackathon #CryptoLife venue, National House Smichov, to the SWARM team to host a mini-summit that will take place on Monday, the 29th of October. The day-long mini summit accommodates 12 talks and a hands-on workshop and is open to the public.

    The Swarm mini-summit will be held in conjunction with EthMagicians’ Council of Prague event. While these two events are entirely separate with different focus, it will be of our great pleasure to host these bright minds under the same roof in joint efforts to work together on the challenges that hinder widespread web3 adoption. Both the SWARM team and EthMagicians will have dedicated spaces within the National House Smichov.
