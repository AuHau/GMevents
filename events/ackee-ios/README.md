    This hands-on workshop will follow the official announcement of iOS DevKit at Devcon conference.

    We will shortly recap what is DevKit about (for those who didn't catch Josef's talk at Devcon) and then get into the funny part - how to use it. We will show how to build an iOS app that uses Ethereum smart contracts under 1 hour.
