# GM Events 

GM Events a community-organized initiative. We have no single
owner. It is an agnostic movement based on the premise that self-organization
is the backbone of the ecosystem. We invite projects, individuals and anyone
interested in fruitful and educational discussions to join us.

This repository contains the code for the website, which can be reached at
